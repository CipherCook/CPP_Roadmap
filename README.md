# CPP_Roadmap
Learning by Doing : C++

---

## 🗓️ Weekly Goals

###  Week 1: Mastering Modern C++ & Clean Code
- [ ] Use smart pointers (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`) in small projects
- [ ] Apply RAII and scope guards
- [ ] Follow best practices from CPP Coding Standards 101
- [ ] Project: Minimal `Vector` implementation
- [ ] Bonus: CSV parser using `fstream` + STL

###  Week 2: STL & Template Programming
- [ ] Solve 10 problems using STL (e.g., `map`, `set`, `priority_queue`)
- [ ] Create a generic Matrix class using templates
- [ ] Implement basic type traits or SFINAE example
- [ ] Project: Type-safe variant class or policy-based set

###  Week 3: Concurrency + Memory + Internals
- [ ] Create a multithreaded logger or downloader
- [ ] Use `std::thread`, `mutex`, and `condition_variable`
- [ ] Profile and debug with Valgrind or perf tools
- [ ] Study cache locality and memory alignment
- [ ] Project: Producer-consumer system with bounded buffer

###  Week 4: Codebases, Testing, and Contributions
- [ ] Pick an open-source C++ project to explore
- [ ] Fix a bug or improve performance/code quality
- [ ] Write unit tests with Catch2 or Google Test
- [ ] Refactor your earlier projects based on new insights

## Tips
- Write a daily log of what you did/learned.
- Push code every day to GitHub with meaningful commits.
- Always profile + refactor — that’s how you grow.
